# HW-Wireframe
Homework - 1st - wireframe

This is my first homework assignment at my UCI full stack web development 25 week boot camp, which started 9/25/17. 

We were required to replicate as pixel perfect as we could, a general wireframe structure of using HTML and CSS.  As this was my first true exposure to HTML CSS, I found this assignment frustrating as I learned how these languages affect each other.  It ended up being pixel perfect, but very usuable as a wireframe. But the point was to learn how to manipulate the graphics, which I was able to build upon on the harder versin of the first homework assignment.
